# Milestone Project 3
## Description
---
This is my third milestone project from the full stack web developer course by Code Institute.
This project was for the data centric part of the course. The purpose of this project was to build an application 
with Python on the backend using the Flask framework. The project should include functionality to make all the CRUD
 operations on a Database, which for this project would be MongoDB.

## Technologies/Support Used
---
Below is a list of technolgies I used to build my dahsboard.
* HTML - HTML5 provided the structure of my website. I tried to use semantic elements where possible to ensure the best structure.
* CSS - Used to style my page.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Used primarily for the grid system. I find this a really good way to position my elements where I want them.
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) - This is my text editor. It has a built in terminal so I could do everything I needed to from one environment.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com) - Git was used for version control. Allowing me to create backups whenever significant changes were made to my code.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - This is where my repository is held externally. I will aslo use GitHub pages to deploy my website.
* [Javascript/Jquery](https://jquery.com/) - Utilised jQuery to manipulate the DOM and add HTML.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Used to import specific fonts I wanted to use on my website.

## Deployment
---
My website was created using VSCode. VSCode is a text editor with a built in terminal. I chose to use a text editor/IDE outside of AWS Cloud9 to gain experience working outside of a browser. Once I had created my file strcuture and first HTML page, i initiated a local repository using GIT which was downloaded onto my machine previously. I then created an external repository in GitHub and linked the local and external repositories. This allowed me to version control throughout the lifespan of the development.

* I created a new environment in VS Code
* In the bash terminal, entered 'git init'
* Created all my folders and files.
* Entered 'git add .' into the bash terminal
* Entered 'git commit' into the bash terminal and created my initial commit
* I then linked my local git repository to a GitHub repository.
* I then followed the below steps to deploy the site to GitHub pages.

To deploy the website to GitHub pages, I followed the below steps:
* Selected the milestone-project-1 from my GitHub dashboard.
* Selected 'Settings' from the menu bar.
* From the GitHub pages section, I chose 'master branch' from the dropdown menu.
* Once selected, the page refreshed and a link was displayed in the GitHub pages section to my wesbite.

## Credits

* To my mentor, [Reuben Ferrante](https://github.com/arex18), for guding me through the process and offering assistance when neccesary to point me in the right direction.
* The Slack community. The help a student is able to receive from the other students is a really great tool to have.
* [HTML Color Code](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/) - Used this website in order to obtain hex codes whilst styling my pages.
* [Clip Art Mag](http://clipartmag.com/) - Used this free website to get the favicon for my website.
* [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) - A validator used to check my HTML and CSS structure and format periodically throughout the build.
* [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) - Used to run JS code through as part of testing.
* [Cacoo](https://app.cacoo.com/o/8g0cBCgjuA/recent) - Used to build wireframes.
